Client Builder Modules are a vital component of the library, designed to simplify the 
process of generating client-side files for front-end applications. Each module is 
defined by a single Setup method, providing developers with access to all application 
resources and dependencies at runtime.

The Setup method in each module provides a centralized location for configuring the module 
and defining its behavior, making the development process more streamlined and consistent. 
Access to all application resources and dependencies allows for seamless integration with 
the rest of the application, reducing the likelihood of version conflicts and making it 
easier to manage dependencies.
